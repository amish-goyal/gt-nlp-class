# Project 3 #

This project includes two parts: CFG and unlabeled dependency parsing. In this part, you are asked to design a CFG to parsing the tweets. In the second part, your job is to design features for dependency parsing (without any implementation on learning and parsing algorithms. 

A bench of files are used for this project. You only need to working on the following files in order to complete your job:

- [the ipython notebook file](Project3-Problem-Set.ipynb)
- [dependency_features.py](parsing/dependency_features.py)
- [Dev data for CFG](oct27.train)
- [Dataset for dependency parsing](data/deppars/)

Please update your local copy to make sure you have all the files (not just the files listed above).

## Notice ##

In your submission, please include **all** your results in ipython notebook.
